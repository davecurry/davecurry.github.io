      <description>Should I add everything or just the good stuff? Just the mostly good stuff I suppose. Started this section in May so it&amp;rsquo;s incomplete, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add things as they&amp;rsquo;re remembered.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for nearly (omg) three decades.
What I love is leading teams and collaborating with highly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating an outstanding customer experience.
Throughout my career, I‚Äôve had the privilege of working on an amazing range of fascinating projects alongside many remarkable collaborators. Looking back, I can see how these diverse and often challenging efforts have profoundly shaped my professional development.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t recall where I first ran across this sound advice, but I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to it many times over the years.
Transcribed thanks to GPT-4-Vision. üòâ
‚ÄúThis sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together are monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It‚Äôs like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve arguably spent way too much time tweaking and futzing my home office setup. Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m at.
Desk
30‚Äù x 60‚Äù Javis Powdercoated Standing Desk in black by Fully. I don‚Äôt think they make this particular model anymore but it‚Äôs perfect for me, especially after adding big, rubbery wheels for rolling on and not destroying our hardwood floors.
Chair
A classic Herman Miller Aeron Chair which I‚Äôve had for nearly 20 years.</description>
