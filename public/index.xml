Transcribed thanks to GPT-4-Vision. üòâ
‚ÄúThis sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together are monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It‚Äôs like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve arguably spent way too much time tweaking and futzing my home office setup. Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m at.
Desk
30‚Äù x 60‚Äù Javis Powdercoated Standing Desk in black by Fully. I don‚Äôt think they make this particular model anymore but it‚Äôs perfect for me, especially after adding big, rubbery wheels for rolling on and not destroying our hardwood floors.
Chair
A classic Herman Miller Aeron Chair which I‚Äôve had for nearly 20 years.</description>
