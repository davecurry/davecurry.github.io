      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for nearly (omg) three decades.
What has always truly excited me is leading and collaborating with highly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating an outstanding customer experience.
Throughout my career, I‚Äôve had the privilege of working on an amazing range of fascinating projects alongside many remarkable individuals. Looking back, I realize how these diverse and challenging experiences have profoundly shaped my professional development.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t recall where I first ran across this sound advice, but I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to it many times over the years.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve arguably spent way too much time tweaking and futzing my home office setup. Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m at.
Desk
30‚Äù x 60‚Äù Javis Powdercoated Standing Desk in black by Fully. I don‚Äôt think they make this particular model anymore but it‚Äôs perfect for me, especially after adding big, rubbery wheels for rolling on and not destroying our hardwood floors.
Chair
A classic Herman Miller Aeron Chair which I‚Äôve had for nearly 20 years.</description>
