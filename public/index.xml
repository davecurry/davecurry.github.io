      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for a long time, coming up on almost (omg) three decades now.
What I love is leading and working closely with teams of wickedly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating outstanding customer experiences.
Over the course of my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on so many interesting things with so many interesting people, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit wild to look back and reflect.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t recall where I first ran across this sound advice, but I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to it many times over the years.

‚ÄúThis sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together are monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It‚Äôs like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve arguably spent way too much time tweaking and futzing my home office setup. Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m at.
Desk
30‚Äù x 60‚Äù Javis Powdercoated Standing Desk in black by Fully. I don‚Äôt think they make this particular model anymore but it‚Äôs perfect for me, especially after adding big, rubbery wheels for rolling on and not destroying our hardwood floors.
Chair
A classic Herman Miller Aeron Chair which I‚Äôve had for nearly 20 years.</description>
