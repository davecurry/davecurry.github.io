      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for nearly (omg) three decades.
What has always truly excited me is leading and collaborating with highly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating an outstanding customer experience.
Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on an amazing range of fascinating projects alongside many remarkable individuals. Looking back, I realize how these diverse and challenging experiences have profoundly shaped my professional development.</description>
