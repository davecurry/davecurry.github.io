      <description>Should I add everything or just the good stuff? Just the mostly good stuff I suppose. Started this section in May so it&amp;rsquo;s incomplete, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add things as they&amp;rsquo;re remembered.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for nearly (omg) three decades.
What I love is leading teams and collaborating with highly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating an outstanding customer experience.
Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on an amazing range of fascinating projects alongside many remarkable collaborators. Looking back, I can see how these diverse and often challenging efforts have profoundly shaped my professional development.</description>
