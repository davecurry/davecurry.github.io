      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for nearly (omg) three decades.
What I love is leading and collaborating with highly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating an outstanding customer experience.
Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working on an amazing range of fascinating projects alongside many remarkable teams and individuals. Looking back, I can see how these diverse and often challenging efforts have profoundly shaped my professional development.</description>
