I've arguably spent way too much time tweaking and futzing my home office setup. Here's where I'm at.

**Desk**

30” x 60” Javis Powdercoated Standing Desk in black by [Fully](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html). I don’t think they make this particular model anymore but it’s perfect for me, especially after adding [big, rubbery wheels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071JDVJN6/) for rolling on and not destroying our hardwood floors.

**Chair**

A classic [Herman Miller Aeron Chair](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-chairs-aeron/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US) which I’ve had for nearly 20 years. The best chair.

**Computer(s)**

One 16" [M1 MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/) for work and one 16" for myself.

**Keyboard & Mouse**

[Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09LK73VHG/) and a [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HM94VDS/). Not a fan of Logitech's software, but the computer switching works well and is essential to my setup.

I'm smitten with this [Onyx Wooden Wrist Rest](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0N6VPL/).

**Monitors**

[LG 35” UltraWide Curved Monitor](https://www.lg.com/us/business/computer-monitors/lg-35bn75c-b) and I’ll never go back to a traditional aspect ratio. Running [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) fullscreen is a treat. 

Laptop screens flank my LG for holding Slack, Outlook, etc.

**Audio & Video**

For Zoom, which I hate to admit I’m on all day, I use a [Logitech Brio 4K](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Calling-Noise-Canceling-Correction-Microsoft/dp/B01N5UOYC4/), which is OK but should be better. My microphone is a [Blue Yeti](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Recording-Streaming-Podcasting-Adjustable/dp/B00N1YPXW2/), mounted low on a compact camera tripod.

Desk speaker is a [Sonos Ray Soundbar](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/ray) connected via optical input and volume controlled with a [Gen 1 IKEA Symfonisk Sound Remote](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892984/ikea-sound-controller-review-symfonisk) (originally in white, but I finally found one in black).

My TV audio is powered by a [Denon AVR-X2800H](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BBZ2972F/) and in-wall Bowers & Wilkins speakers. Sound is good.

**Dock**

Everyting connects to an [OWC Thunderbolt Dock](https://www.owc.com/solutions/thunderbolt-dock) (one with optical audio input) and really, is there any other way? Gotta have a reliable dock. 

**Phones**

Android and iOS phones and tablets are always around for testing, but two are persistent, an iPhone 15 Pro Max and an adorable iPhone Mini for work. A tiny phone for testing, I told myself.

**Notebooks and Pens**

Always have pen and paper nearby for reminders, quick notes, and miscellany. [Moleskine Classic Soft Cover](https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/the-legendary-notebook/classic-notebook-black-8053853602800.html), preferably large and squared.

My go-to pens for years was the [Uni-ball Signo Gel Ink Pen 0.38mm in Black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXWGWE/) but a stellar design lead turned me on to the [Pilot Juice Up Retractable Gel Ink 0.4mm in Navy Blue Black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HGPWNXB/) and that's my new day-to-day pen.

**TV Devices, Remotes & Controllers**

I love working on streaming apps, especially for connected TVs. My office TV is a [65" Sony X900H](https://www.sony.com/en-cd/electronics/televisions/x90h-series) and connected to it are a wide variety of TV devices:

+ [HDMI Switcher](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WV5YJ6H/)
+ Amazon Fire TVs
+ Apple TVs (with new and old remotes... let's not talk about the old swipe remote)
+ Google Chromecast w/ Google TV (not confusingly named at all)
+ Playstation 5
+ Roku Devices
+ XBOX Series S
+ And a few others that aren't always on, but can be quickly hooked up

All CTV devices have fixed IPs on my network for easier build deployments and the signals are split and sent to the TV and an [Elgato HD60 X](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-HD60-External-Capture-Card/dp/B09V1KJ3J4) for screen captures/recordings, etc. Required, obviously.

**There's More, But...**

The music stuff, the gaming stuff, the other computer stuff... for another time perhaps.
