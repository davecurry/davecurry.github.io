I've been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for a long time, coming close to almost (omg) three decades now.

What I love is leading and working closely with teams of wickedly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating outstanding customer experiences.

Over the course of my career, I've worked on so many interesting things with so many interesting people, it's a bit wild to look back and reflect. I know I've been shaped by being in the pressure cooker for so long and surviving and thriving across an almost unbelievable variety of projects and products over the years. 

The result has instilled in me a great understanding of how to work with people, how to get things done (and done well), and how to provide stable and consistent leadership within an organization.
