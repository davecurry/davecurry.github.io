I've been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for nearly (omg) three decades.

What I love is leading and collaborating with highly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating an outstanding customer experience.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on an amazing range of fascinating projects alongside many remarkable teams and individuals. Looking back, I can see how these diverse and often challenging efforts have profoundly shaped my professional development.

My extensive journey has grown within me with a deep understanding of effective teamwork, efficient execution, and the ability to provide stable, consistent leadership within an organization.

#### Fair warning:
          
In addition to design I've done my fair share of development and still write code on the side... I know just enough to be dangerous.

And my, how time flies.
