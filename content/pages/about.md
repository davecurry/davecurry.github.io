I've been designing and developing digital products and entertainment experiences for nearly (omg) three decades.

What has always truly excited me is leading and collaborating with highly intelligent designers and partners, all of us obsessed with creating an outstanding customer experience.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on an amazing range of fascinating projects alongside many remarkable teams and individuals. Looking back, I realize how these diverse and challenging efforts have profoundly shaped my professional development.

My extensive journey has endowed me with a deep understanding of effective teamwork, efficient execution, and the ability to provide stable, consistent leadership within an organization.

And my, how time flies.
